# pong-raylib
This is my first step in learning graphics by using RayLib to build a variety of projects starting with a Pong clone and ending (if everything goes according to plan) with a Minecraft-like game (couldn't have possibly picked a more saturated set of projects, not a bad choice in that it will help beginners like myself with more well-documented projects).

I originally planned to start with a Tetris-like clone, but I found that I'd first like to know the ropes using a simpler project first.

## Finalizing and archiving the project
This will be the last commit to the mini-project after which I will archive it and might not review it further. As the project was made for learning I believe seeking any further improvements in the project might not bear fruit to learn from; although I believe any interesting programming will teach you something, some projects are more effective than others. I believe I have come to understand how RayLib works and will move on to other projects now. Finally I would like to thank any contributers to [RayLib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and especially Ramon Santamaria the creator of the RayLib library for all the beautiful work he has done.

Feel free to contact me through my email.
