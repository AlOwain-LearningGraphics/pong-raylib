# pong-raylib
This is my first step in learning graphics by using RayLib to build a variety of projects starting with a Pong clone and ending (if everything goes according to plan) with a Minecraft-like game (couldn't have possibly picked a more saturated set of projects, not a bad choice in that it will help beginners like myself with more well-documented projects).
